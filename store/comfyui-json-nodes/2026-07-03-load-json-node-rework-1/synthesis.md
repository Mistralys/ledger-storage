## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-03
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

All five improvements deferred from the prior `LoadJsonNode` cycle were implemented: two code-hardening items (empty-filename guard via `_guard_input_path()`, 50 MB file-size cap), one DRY refactor (`_guard_input_path()` centralises the duplicated path-traversal guard), and two project-organisation items (test files moved to `tests/`, defunct scaffold removed). All acceptance criteria were met and all tests pass.

### Implementation Summary
- Added `_guard_input_path(filename)` module-level helper to `nodes.py` — centralises the path-traversal guard and empty-filename check; raises `ValueError` with user-friendly message for empty input.
- Added `_MAX_JSON_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024` module-level constant to `nodes.py`.
- Refactored `LoadJsonNode.fingerprint_inputs()` to use `_guard_input_path()`; returns `""` on any `ValueError` so ComfyUI degrades gracefully.
- Refactored `LoadJsonNode.execute()` to use `_guard_input_path()` and added `os.path.getsize()` pre-check against `_MAX_JSON_FILE_SIZE`.
- Created `tests/` directory; moved `verify_wp003.py` there with path fix (`os.path.dirname` one level deeper) and added new test cases for all new guards.
- Deleted `qa_test_wp003.py` (no assertions; obsolete).

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md` — Added `_guard_input_path()` helper entry and `Module-Level Constants` table (`_KEY_COMPONENT_MAX_LENGTH`, `_MAX_JSON_FILE_SIZE`, `_MISSING`); removed duplicate `_MISSING` standalone section.
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/file-tree.md` — Added `tests/verify_wp003.py`; updated `nodes.py` helper list to include `_guard_input_path`.
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/constraints.md` — Added 50 MB file-size cap constraint under Non-Negotiable Design Decisions; updated testing strategy note to reflect `tests/` directory is now established.
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/data-flows.md` — Updated `LoadJsonNode` execution flow (steps 3–9) to reflect `_guard_input_path()`, empty-filename guard, and file-size check.
- `docs/agents/projects/json-node-project.md` — Added 50 MB cap and empty-filename guard behavioral constraints to the `LoadJsonNode` spec section.
- `README.md` — Added "Files larger than 50 MB are also rejected" note to the JSON Load File section.
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated section 6 file layout: added `_guard_input_path` to helper list, added `tests/` directory.
- `changelog.md` — Added v1.2.1 entry documenting all changes.

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `tests/verify_wp003.py`
- Static analysis run: none (pure Python, no linter configured)
- Result: All tests pass (14/14); 0 failures

### Code Insights
- [low] (debt) `nodes.py` — The `_MISSING` sentinel was previously described inline under a standalone `### _MISSING (module-level sentinel)` heading in `api-surface.md`, rather than in the constants table. This has been corrected as part of the documentation pass; no code change was needed.
- [low] (improvement) `nodes.py` — `SaveJsonNode`'s path-traversal guard (subfolder validation) is structurally similar to the old inline guard in `LoadJsonNode` but validates a directory rather than a filename. It is currently left as-is per the plan's scope constraint. A future improvement could extract a more general `_guard_path(base_dir, candidate_path)` helper if a third file-I/O node is ever added.
- [low] (convention) `nodes.py` — The `_deep_merge` helper was missing from the `nodes.py` comment in `file-tree.md` and `AGENTS.md`. This was corrected during the documentation pass.

### Additional Comments
- `verify_wp003.py` was fully moved from the repo root to `tests/verify_wp003.py`; the root-level copy was deleted.
