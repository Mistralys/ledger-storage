## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-04
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

Added `JsonRerouteNode` — a typed passthrough node for `JSON_OBJECT` connections — as the fifteenth node in the suite. The implementation follows the exact same patterns as all existing nodes (V3 API, deep copy for fork-safety, `_coerce_json_object()` guard) and required no new helpers or dependencies. All documentation was updated to reflect the new node and corrected node counts.

### Implementation Summary
- Added `JsonRerouteNode` class to `nodes.py` after `JsonMergeObjectsNode` and before getter nodes, with one optional `JSON_OBJECT` input and one `JSON_OBJECT` output
- Registered the node in `__init__.py` (import + `get_node_list()` entry) after `JsonMergeObjectsNode`
- The `execute()` method is a single line: `copy.deepcopy(_coerce_json_object(json_object) or {})` — reusing established helpers

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/agents/projects/json-node-project.md` — Added "JSON Reroute" node specification between "JSON Merge Objects" and "JSON to String"
- `AGENTS.md` — Updated node count from fourteen/14 to fifteen/15 in Project Stats (Architecture row), file layout comment, and Failure Protocol table
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md` — Added node to Summary table, added schema documentation in Structural Nodes section, updated `get_node_list()` return list
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/file-tree.md` — Updated node count in `nodes.py` comment from 14 to 15
- `docs/agents/project-manifest/data-flows.md` — Added "JSON Reroute" data flow section
- `README.md` — Added JSON Reroute to the Structural Nodes table (renamed section to "Combine, Convert, and Route")

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: Static error check on `nodes.py` and `__init__.py`
- Static analysis run: VS Code diagnostics (Python language server)
- Result: No errors in modified files

### Code Insights
- [low] (improvement) `nodes.py`: No observations — the code in the touched files is clean, consistent, and follows established patterns uniformly. The helper functions (`_coerce_json_object`, `_deep_merge`, etc.) are well-factored and the new node slots in naturally.

### Additional Comments
- The node is intentionally trivial — one line of logic using existing helpers. No tests were written per the plan's "Out of Scope" section; manual testing in ComfyUI is the recommended verification approach.
