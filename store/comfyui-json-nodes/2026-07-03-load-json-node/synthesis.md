# Synthesis Report — JSON Load File Node

**Project:** `2026-07-03-load-json-node`
**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This cycle added the `LoadJsonNode` (`JSON Load File`) to the `comfyui-json-nodes` package — the fourteenth node and the natural counterpart to the existing `SaveJsonNode`. The node presents a dropdown listing all `.json` files in ComfyUI's input directory (populated at startup via `_list_json_files()`), reads the selected file with mtime-based cache invalidation via `fingerprint_inputs()`, validates that the top-level value is a dict, and returns the parsed content as a `JSON_OBJECT`. All 9 acceptance criteria were met. The cycle passed every pipeline stage (implementation, QA, security-audit, code-review, documentation) with no blocking issues.

The orchestrator encountered an interruption mid-run; the Ledger Doctor repaired the stale state and the pipeline resumed cleanly from the correct checkpoint without data loss.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Gold Nuggets

1. **mtime-based `fingerprint_inputs` over `not_idempotent`** — The implementation correctly uses `fingerprint_inputs()` returning `str(os.path.getmtime(...))` for cache invalidation. This avoids redundant disk reads for static config files while still detecting on-disk changes. This pattern is now established for all future loader nodes in the project.

2. **Path-traversal guard convention is solid** — The `os.path.realpath() + startswith(real_input + os.sep)` guard is applied in both `execute()` and `fingerprint_inputs()`. The inline duplication is consistent with `SaveJsonNode` and is intentional project convention. A module-level `_guard_input_path()` helper would be a minor DRY improvement if the number of file-I/O nodes grows.

3. **`verify_wp003.py` establishes regression test pattern** — The project officially uses manual ComfyUI testing (per AGENTS.md), but this cycle produced a standalone mock-based verification script that runs without a live ComfyUI instance. This pattern (mock `folder_paths`; test all ACs programmatically) should be used for future node additions.

4. **Ledger Doctor pattern works well** — The orchestrator crash recovery via Ledger Doctor (auto-cancel orphaned pipeline + unclaim WP) restored the project to a clean routing state without data loss. The `auto_cancelled: true` flag correctly excluded the orphaned pipeline from the rework budget.

## Deferred & Follow-Up Items

| Item | Source | Agent | Type | Priority | Description |
|------|--------|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Empty-filename UX gap | WP-003 QA/Security/Review | QA, Security Auditor, Reviewer | Deferred | Low | When no `.json` files exist in the input directory, `define_schema()` substitutes `['']` as a placeholder. Calling `execute('')` raises a `PermissionError`-wrapped `ValueError` rather than a clear "no file selected" message. README now documents the restart requirement, but the node itself could benefit from an explicit early guard in `execute()` for `filename == ''`. |
| File-size cap in `execute()` | WP-003 Security Audit | Security Auditor | Deferred | Low | `execute()` uses `fh.read()` with no size cap. A malicious or accidentally large `.json` file could cause excessive memory use. Exploitability is minimal (local desktop tool, user controls files), but `os.path.getsize()` pre-check would add defense-in-depth. Recommended: add configurable `MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` guard. |
| `_guard_input_path()` helper refactor | WP-003 Code Review | Reviewer | Deferred | Low | The 4-line path-traversal guard is copy-pasted between `fingerprint_inputs()` and `execute()`. A shared module-level helper would reduce duplication. Not blocking — consistent with existing `SaveJsonNode` style — but worth revisiting if a third file-I/O node is added. |
| `qa_test_wp003.py` cleanup | WP-003 QA/Review | QA, Reviewer | Deferred | Low | `qa_test_wp003.py` in the repo root is an incomplete test scaffold with no assertions. It now has a header comment pointing to `verify_wp003.py`, but the file could be removed entirely. Retained for now to avoid an unrequested destructive operation. |
| Windows reserved device name bypass | WP-003 (inherited from prior cycle) | Security Auditor | Out-of-scope | Medium | The prior cycle's security audit flagged that Windows reserved device names (e.g. `CON`, `NUL`) bypass `os.path.basename()` sanitization. The `LoadJsonNode` is not affected (files are selected from a scanned combo, not entered as freeform text) — but this is an outstanding concern for any node that accepts freeform path/filename input. |

## Next Steps

1. **Review deferred items** (priority-ordered): the file-size cap and empty-filename guard are the most actionable improvements for a follow-up cycle.
2. **Consider a `tests/` directory** for the project: `verify_wp003.py` lives in the repo root by happenstance. A `tests/` subdirectory with a test runner would make regression coverage more discoverable and maintainable.
3. **No further work required for this plan's scope.** The package now has 14 nodes. The load/save cycle is complete.
