## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-22
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary
The Insights tab removal was implemented across the GUI entry points, route handling, backend wiring, tests, and manifest references. The user-facing navigation and obsolete Insights view code are gone, and the Knowledge view remains as the forward-looking cross-cutting experience.

### Implementation Summary
- Removed the global Insights navigation entry and route branch from the SPA shell and router.
- Removed the obsolete Insights API client method and server-side GUI handler wiring.
- Deleted the old Insights view implementation and updated GUI tests to reflect the new Knowledge-focused behavior.
- Cleaned up MCP server manifest references so the documentation matches the current route surface.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated the MCP server project manifest references to remove stale Insights route/view documentation.

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: vitest run tests/gui/server-knowledge-routes.test.ts tests/gui/insights-knowledge-links.test.ts
- Static analysis run: none required for this scoped GUI cleanup
- Result: PASS

### Code Insights
- [medium] (refactor) mcp-server/gui/public/views/knowledge.js: The Knowledge view’s tab-based filtering is now covered by targeted GUI tests; future changes to its link rendering should keep these cases in sync.
- [low] (improvement) mcp-server/tests/gui/insights-knowledge-links.test.ts: The harness now explicitly exercises the async load path, which is more resilient to future view lifecycle changes.

### Additional Comments
- The feature removal was completed without introducing a redirect to Knowledge; the old Insights endpoint now returns a 404 and the old view file has been removed.
