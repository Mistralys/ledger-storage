## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-24
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

Added the `ledger_ping` MCP tool as a lightweight (~50-token) health-check alternative to `ledger_help` (~2,000 tokens). The tool returns reachability status, running server version, stale-instance detection, and uptime. The PM persona preflight partial was updated to use `ledger_ping` instead of `ledger_help`, so agents now catch stale servers at the very start of a run with explicit `stale` field checking rather than inferring health from a successful documentation response.

### Implementation Summary
- Created `mcp-server/src/tools/ping.ts` — zero-argument tool returning `status`, `server_version`, `stale` (boolean or null), `uptime_seconds`, and optional `stale_detail`; resilient to `readPackageVersion()` I/O failures (returns `stale: null` with explanation instead of propagating an opaque MCP error)
- Registered `ledger_ping` in `mcp-server/src/index.ts` — added import, `register()` call, and updated the manually-maintained tool list in the startup log
- Added `ledger_ping` to `mcp-server/src/tools/help-content.ts` — overview table row and per-tool help entry with response field descriptions, action guidance, and example responses
- Updated `personas/ledger/src/partials/mcp-preflight-verify-no-detect.md` — replaced `ledger_help` with `ledger_ping`, added explicit `stale` field checking with three action branches (stale: true → stop; stale: null → proceed with caution; tool failure → stop)
- Updated `personas/ledger/src/meta/2-project-manager.yaml` — added `ledger_ping` as the first entry in `mcp_tools` with purpose description
- Rebuilt all persona output files via `node scripts/build-personas.js` — all three PM targets (vs-code, claude-code, deep-agents) now reference `ledger_ping` in their preflight section and MCP tools table

### Documentation Updates
- `mcp-server/docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md` — added "Health Check Tools" section with full `ledger_ping` signature and response shape documentation; corrected tool count from "30 Total" to "32 Total" (the existing header was already stale at 30 when 31 tools were registered; now 32)
- `mcp-server/docs/agents/project-manifest/file-tree.md` — added `ping.ts` entry under `src/tools/` with annotated description

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `mcp-server/tests/tools/ping.test.ts` (5 tests), full `mcp-server` Vitest suite (123 test files, 3,672 tests)
- Static analysis run: `tsc --noEmit` (MCP server) — one type error discovered and fixed (discriminated union construction via spread; resolved by building each branch explicitly)
- Result: PASS — all tests green, no type errors

### Code Insights
- [low] (debt) `mcp-server/docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md`: The "MCP Tools (N Total)" header was already stale (showing 30 when 31 tools were registered). Consider adding a validation script or CI check that counts registered tools in `index.ts` and asserts the header matches.
- [low] (improvement) `mcp-server/src/tools/ping.ts`: The `PingResponseFresh` / `PingResponseUnknownStaleness` discriminated union required explicit branching instead of a spread to satisfy TypeScript's narrowing. This is a minor DX friction — the union shape itself is clear; the construction pattern is just TypeScript's limitation. No action needed.

### Additional Comments
- The api-surface.md tool count correction (30 → 32) fixes a pre-existing documentation drift: 31 tools were registered before this plan, but the header read 30. This plan added the 32nd tool.
