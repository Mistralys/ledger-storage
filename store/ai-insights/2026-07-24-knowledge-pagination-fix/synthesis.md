## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-24
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

Fixed the `listInsights()` multi-store branch in `mcp-server/src/tools/knowledge.ts` to apply `limit` and `offset` globally after merging and deduplicating results from all stores, rather than forwarding them per-store. This closes the last known pagination correctness gap: a `limit=N` request now returns at most N results regardless of how many stores are configured. Four new integration tests cover the corrected behavior and codify the pre-existing correctness of `searchInsights()`.

### Implementation Summary
- Removed `limit` and `offset` from the per-store `manager.listInsights()` call in the multi-store branch so each store returns all matching insights untruncated.
- Deleted the four-line comment that explicitly acknowledged the bug.
- Added a post-merge global pagination slice (`results.slice(start, start + args.limit)`) after the merge+dedup loop, mirroring the pattern from `searchInsights()` and `MultiStoreManager.listKnowledge()` (WP-009).
- Added four integration tests in `knowledge-multi-store.test.ts`: three covering `listInsights()` global pagination (AC-01 limit, AC-02 offset, AC-03 limit+offset window) and one codifying the pre-existing correct behavior of `searchInsights()` global limit (AC-06).
- `storeIdByInsightId` map correctness is preserved: the map is populated during the merge loop before pagination slices, so every surviving insight still has its `storeId` entry.

### Documentation Updates
- No documentation updates required. The `ListInsightsSchema` is unchanged (public interface is unaffected); the fix corrects runtime behavior to match already-documented semantics. The stale in-code bug-acknowledgement comment was removed as part of the fix.

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `mcp-server/tests/tools/knowledge-multi-store.test.ts` (targeted), full `npx vitest run` suite (136 test files)
- Static analysis run: none configured beyond TypeScript compilation (no standalone lint step)
- Result: 3887/3887 tests pass; 0 regressions

### Code Insights
- [low] (debt) `mcp-server/src/tools/knowledge.ts` — The direct-iteration path in `listInsights()` (and `searchInsights()`) duplicates store-traversal logic that also lives in `MultiStoreManager`. The pattern works correctly but will drift if the merge/dedup strategy ever changes. The plan's out-of-scope item (add `storeId` tagging to `MultiStoreManager` methods and drop the direct-iteration path) would eliminate this duplication — worth considering for a follow-up WP.
- [low] (improvement) `mcp-server/tests/tools/knowledge-multi-store.test.ts` — The `seedSixInsights()` helper is declared inside the `describe` block. If additional pagination tests are added in future, extracting it to the module-level helpers section (alongside `initTwoStoreContext` etc.) would make it reusable without repetition.

### Additional Comments
- AC-04 (`formatted_id` correctness after pagination) is covered by the pre-existing `'listInsights: each insight formatted_id reflects its owning store'` test in the WP-002 describe block, which remains unchanged and continues to pass.
- AC-05 (legacy single-store branch unchanged) is covered by the existing `knowledge.test.ts` single-store suite, which ran clean.
