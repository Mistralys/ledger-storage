# Synthesis Report — Knowledge Accumulation System

**Project:** `2026-05-28-knowledge-accumulation-system`
**Session Date:** 2026-05-28
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours (13:00–15:33 UTC)
**Status:** COMPLETE — 7/7 work packages passed all pipeline stages

---

## Executive Summary

The Knowledge Accumulation System is fully implemented and deployed. The Synthesis agent can
now commit reusable insights ("gold nuggets") to a persistent, file-backed knowledge store and
all workflow agents can query that store during their pipelines. Specifically:

- A new **`.knowledge/` directory** at the ledger root stores global insights
  (`global-insights.json`) and per-project insights (`{slug}-insights.json`).
- A **Zod schema layer** (`src/schema/knowledge.ts`) defines `Insight` and `KnowledgeStore`
  types with full TypeScript inference and a dual-layer path-traversal guard on `project_slug`.
- A **`KnowledgeStoreManager`** (`src/storage/knowledge-store.ts`) provides all CRUD
  operations — atomic writes, file-lock serialization, ID sequencing (`KN-NNNN`), and
  case-insensitive search — with `.knowledge/` excluded from project enumeration.
- **4 new MCP tools** (`ledger_add_insight`, `ledger_search_insights`, `ledger_list_insights`,
  `ledger_update_insight`) are registered in the server, appear in the tool registry (30 total),
  and have help content wired into `ledger_help`.
- The **Synthesis persona** (`9-synthesis.yaml`) has a new dedicated Knowledge Collection phase
  (partial + numbered workflow step 8), with confidence heuristics and a deduplication
  pre-flight step.
- **4 consumer personas** (Developer, QA, Security Auditor, Reviewer) have `ledger_search_insights`
  added with role-appropriate purpose descriptions.
- A **batch migration script** (`scripts/migrate-synthesis-insights.js`) can extract insights
  from all existing `synthesis.md` files via the Anthropic API with `--dry-run`, `--project`,
  `--limit`, and `--resume` flags.
- All **manifest documents** are updated (api-surface.md, file-tree.md, data-flows.md,
  constraints.md, AGENTS.md) and both module changelogs are bumped (mcp-server v1.31.0,
  personas v3.22.0).

## Failed / Blocked Pipelines

### WP-002 — Security Audit FAIL (A01 Path Traversal, High)

The Security Auditor identified that `projectStorePath(slug)` interpolated `slug` directly into
`path.join()` without validation. A `../evil` or `../../etc/passwd` slug could escape the
`.knowledge/` directory.

**Resolution:** Dual-layer defense:
1. `_validateSlug(slug)` private guard in `KnowledgeStoreManager` — rejects slugs not matching
   `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$` before any file I/O.
2. Matching Zod `.regex(...)` refinement on `InsightSchema.project_slug` — closes the attack
   surface at parse time for `addInsight()`.

Both layers share `PROJECT_SLUG_REGEX` (exported constant from `schema/knowledge.ts`) to
prevent pattern drift.

### WP-002 — Code Review FAIL (`_loadInsights()` silently over-returned)

The Reviewer identified that `_loadInsights({ project_slug: 'x' })` without an explicit `scope`
loaded all stores rather than narrowing to project `x`. This would have caused `searchInsights`
and `listInsights` to silently return over-broad results to MCP tool callers.

**Resolution:** Fixed in the same implementation rework cycle as the security remediation,
before the MCP tool layer (WP-003) was built.

---

## Strategic Recommendations (Gold Nuggets)

### 1. Share validation constants across schema + storage layers

`PROJECT_SLUG_REGEX` is the single source of truth for slug validation, exported from
`schema/knowledge.ts` and consumed by both `InsightSchema.project_slug` and
`KnowledgeStoreManager._validateSlug()`. This pattern — define once in the schema, reference
in the storage guard — eliminates drift risk and should be adopted for any future string-format
constraints that must be enforced at both schema-parse time and runtime.

### 2. Fix the 3 pre-existing GUI test failures as a standalone WP

Every WP in this session flagged 3 failing tests as noise:
- `tests/gui/api-client.test.ts` (×2) — `orchestratorDismiss` endpoint URL mismatch
- `tests/gui/orchestrator-view.test.ts` (×1) — missing `.orch-project-link` element

These failures pre-date this implementation cycle and inflate the "tests failed" count in every
pipeline report. They should be fixed in a dedicated work package to restore a clean baseline.

### 3. Numbered workflow steps in persona files must include all phases

WP-004 revealed that the Synthesis persona's numbered steps (1–9) did not reference the new
Knowledge Collection phase, meaning an agent following only those steps would skip it
entirely. The Documentation agent caught and fixed this, but the root cause is structural:
numbered step lists in persona templates can fall out of sync with additive partials.

**Recommendation:** Treat persona workflow step lists as immutable contracts. Any new phase
partial must be paired with a numbered-step addition in the same implementation PR. The
Documentation pipeline's responsibility should include cross-checking partial count against
step count.

### 4. CJS/ESM boundary limits script reuse of TypeScript storage modules

`scripts/migrate-synthesis-insights.js` had to reimplement knowledge store read/write
operations inline because the TypeScript `KnowledgeStoreManager` cannot be `require()`d from
a CJS script. The inline code is simpler but creates a synchronization risk if the storage
format evolves.

**Options:** (a) Add a compiled CJS-compatible `dist/storage/knowledge-store.js` to the build
output contract and document it as a stable scripting interface, or (b) migrate workspace scripts
to ESM (`import` + `"type": "module"` in root `package.json`). Option (b) is the cleaner
long-term fix but requires auditing all `scripts/*.js` files.

### 5. `updateInsight` needs an optional scope filter to avoid ambiguous store resolution

`updateInsight` and `deleteInsight` scan stores alphabetically, so `global-insights.json` is
always searched before `{slug}-insights.json`. An agent holding a numeric ID that exists in
both stores will update the global insight silently. This was flagged by QA, the Security
Auditor, and the Reviewer independently — strong signal that the API surface has a clarity
gap. Adding `scope?` and `project_slug?` parameters to `ledger_update_insight` would make
intent unambiguous and prevent accidental global-insight mutation.

### 6. Confidence field semantics should be finalized before production use

`InsightSchema.confidence` is `z.number()` with no range constraint. The migration script and
the persona guidance assume 0–1 semantics (high: 0.9–1.0), but `Infinity` and negative values
are silently accepted. Before the knowledge store accumulates significant data, the field should
be locked to `z.number().min(0).max(1)` to prevent silent data quality issues.

## Next Steps for Planner / Manager

1. **Fix pre-existing GUI test failures** — Create a WP targeting
   `tests/gui/api-client.test.ts` and `tests/gui/orchestrator-view.test.ts` to restore a
   clean test baseline (0 failures in the full suite).

2. **Run the batch migration** — Execute `node scripts/migrate-synthesis-insights.js --dry-run`
   against the existing project ledgers to preview extractable insights, then run without
   `--dry-run` once the dry-run output is reviewed. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
   environment.

3. **Add scope filter to `ledger_update_insight`** — Low-effort follow-up to make the update
   tool unambiguous (see Gold Nugget #5 above).

4. **Finalize `confidence` field constraints** — Add `z.number().min(0).max(1)` to
   `InsightSchema` once the 0–1 semantic is confirmed and update the migration script's
   heuristic table accordingly.

5. **GUI Knowledge page (Phase 6)** — Deferred at plan inception; now unblocked. Implement
   a `/knowledge` route in the MCP server GUI to surface insights across projects.

6. **Root changelog entry** — The module changelogs (mcp-server v1.31.0, personas v3.22.0)
   are complete. A root `changelog.md` entry should be written to create a Git-tagged release
   that captures this feature.
