## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-06
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

All four actionable items from the previous plan's synthesis were implemented: Verbatim AC Text guidance was extended to the four remaining pipeline-completing personas (Security Auditor, Reviewer, Release Engineer, Documentation), `personas/README.md` was rewritten with accurate current counts, and the hardcoded `PERSONA_FILES` array in `scripts/build-personas.js` was replaced with a dynamic directory scan. The full build produces 120 files across all suites and passes freshness check.

### Implementation Summary
- Added Verbatim AC Text numbered item to `docs-operational-protocol.md` (item 6), `security-auditor-operational-protocol.md` (item 6), and `release-engineer-operational-protocol.md` (item 9); added a heading+paragraph block to `reviewer-operational-protocol.md` (end of file), matching each file's existing formatting structure.
- Bumped changelog entries for personas 5 (Security Auditor → 3.6.4), 6 (Reviewer → 3.6.2), 7 (Release Engineer → 3.7.3), and 8 (Documentation → 3.7.2).
- Added `v3.27.0` entry to `personas/changelog.md` covering all three WPs.
- Rewrote `personas/README.md`: suite count 2→3 (added ledger-support), standalone count 16→21, added deep-agents as third target, total generated files 48→120, directory tree updated to show all three suites and their three output directories each.
- Replaced the 9-element hardcoded `PERSONA_FILES` array and its sync-warning comment in `scripts/build-personas.js` with a `fs.readdirSync()` + filter + numeric sort — functionally identical output, zero coupling.

### Documentation Updates
- `personas/changelog.md` — Added `v3.27.0` release entry covering all three WPs.
- `personas/README.md` — Rewrote stale counts and suite descriptions to reflect current build output.
- No updates required to root `AGENTS.md` — the `build-personas.js` table entry does not reference the removed coupling comment.

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `node scripts/build-personas.js --suite all` (build pass), `node scripts/build-personas.js --check --suite all` (freshness check)
- Static analysis run: n/a — persona source changes only (no TypeScript)
- Result: PASS — build exits 0, 120 personas processed and 120 files written; check mode exits 0; `grep -l "Verbatim AC Text"` confirms all 6 operational protocol partials; `diff` on `name-mapping.json` before/after shows only the 4 expected version string changes, confirming the directory scan produces the same mapping as the hardcoded list.

### Code Insights
- [low] (improvement) `personas/README.md`: The "update this count when adding personas" note was added inline in the file — consider adding a `--check` variant that validates the README file count string against the actual build output to catch future staleness programmatically.
- [low] (debt) `scripts/build-personas.js` `parseYamlScalars()`: The function docstring warns that trailing inline YAML comments are not stripped from scalar values. This is safe today because persona YAML files have no such comments, but there is no validation that enforces this. A future contributor could add a trailing comment and silently corrupt `name-mapping.json`. A one-line guard or a note in the personas constraints doc would prevent this.
- [low] (improvement) `personas/ledger-support/README.md`: The plan references this file in the updated README's "Further Reading" section, but the file may not yet exist (the ledger-support suite was added later). Verify the link is not broken when the README is rendered.

### Additional Comments
- The v3.26.0 WIP entry in `personas/changelog.md` was not closed/released as part of this plan — it was left in its existing state per the changelog convention (module changelogs are not Git-tagged; v3.26.0 remains WIP).
- `personas/package.json` was automatically updated from `3.26.0` → `3.27.0` by the build script's `sync-version` step, consistent with the version in `personas/changelog.md`.
