## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-09
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

`ledger_search_insights` now tokenizes its `query` on whitespace and applies OR semantics: an insight matches if any token appears in its title, content, or tags. Multi-token results are ranked by descending match count. The change is fully backward-compatible — single-token queries produce identical output, empty/whitespace queries return all insights, and all 3300 existing tests continue to pass.

### Implementation Summary

- **`mcp-server/src/storage/knowledge-store.ts`** — Replaced the single `const q = query.toLowerCase()` + `.filter()` block in `KnowledgeStoreManager.searchInsights()` with a three-branch tokenized implementation: (1) empty tokens → return all insights, (2) single token → existing substring filter with stable insertion order, (3) multi-token → OR match with descending match-count sort. Updated JSDoc accordingly.
- **`mcp-server/src/tools/knowledge.ts`** — Updated `SearchInsightsSchema` `query` field description to accurately reflect OR semantics and match-count ranking for MCP clients.
- **`mcp-server/tests/storage/knowledge-store.test.ts`** — Added five new tests covering OR results (AC-01), match-count ranking (AC-02), single-term backward compat (AC-03), empty query (AC-04), and whitespace-only query (AC-05).
- **`mcp-server/tests/tools/knowledge.test.ts`** — Added one smoke test that exercises the full tool-layer path with a multi-term query (AC-01).
- **`mcp-server/docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md`** — Updated `ledger_search_insights` parameter description and prose to document OR semantics, match-count ranking, and the complementary relationship between `query` (OR) and `tags` (AND).

### Documentation Updates
- `mcp-server/docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md` — Updated `ledger_search_insights` entry to describe OR logic, match-count ranking, and the empty-query behavior (AC-06).

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `mcp-server` full Vitest suite
- Static analysis run: `tsc --noEmit`
- Result: 3300 tests passed (114 test files), zero TypeScript errors

### Code Insights
- [low] (improvement) `mcp-server/src/storage/knowledge-store.ts`: The `as string` cast on `tokens[0]` is needed because TypeScript does not narrow array access by length guards. A minor alternative would be destructuring (`const [q] = tokens`) which is typed as `string | undefined` — the same issue. The cast is the clearest fix at zero cost; worth noting if the project ever enables `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in `tsconfig.json` (it would then require explicit guard or destructuring with `!`).
- [low] (improvement) `mcp-server/src/storage/knowledge-store.ts`: The multi-token path iterates all insights twice (once to score, once to map after sort). For the current small-store use case this is negligible, but if the knowledge store grows significantly, a single-pass scored-sort pattern could be marginally more efficient.

### Additional Comments
- The `as string` narrowing cast in the single-token branch is the only deviation from pure type inference; it is intentional and documents the constraint clearly via the comment.
- Changelog entries are intentionally out of scope per the plan.
