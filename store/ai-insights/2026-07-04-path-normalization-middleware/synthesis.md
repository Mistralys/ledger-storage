## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-06
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

Implemented `PathNormalizationMiddleware`, a `AgentMiddleware` subclass that intercepts Deep Agents tool calls and rewrites Windows drive-letter paths to virtual `/`-rooted paths before `validate_path()` runs. The middleware is wired into every `create_deep_agent()` call in `src/nodes/__init__.py` and is a zero-cost no-op on macOS/Linux. All plan acceptance criteria are met: 25 new unit tests and 1 integration test were added, all passing alongside the full existing test suite (zero regressions).

### Implementation Summary
- Created `orchestrator/src/utils/path_middleware.py` — `PathNormalizationMiddleware(AgentMiddleware)` with `_to_virtual()`, `_rewrite_args()`, and `awrap_tool_call()`.
- Modified `orchestrator/src/nodes/__init__.py` — imported `PathNormalizationMiddleware` at module level; instantiated `path_middleware = PathNormalizationMiddleware(target_path)` after `LocalShellBackend` construction; added `middleware=[path_middleware]` to `create_deep_agent()` call.
- Created `orchestrator/tests/test_path_middleware.py` — 25 unit tests covering path rewriting, passthrough, case-insensitivity, `_active` flag, and full `awrap_tool_call` flow.
- Added `TestPathMiddlewareWiring.test_middleware_passed_to_create_deep_agent` to `orchestrator/tests/test_nodes.py` — integration test verifying wiring and `_root` value.
- Extended `orchestrator/src/nodes/templates/partials/project-path-reminder.md` — added note informing agents that file tools accept both path formats and return `/`-rooted virtual paths.

### Documentation Updates
- `orchestrator/docs/agents/project-manifest/constraints.md` — added Constraint 26 documenting the `PathNormalizationMiddleware` requirement for all `create_deep_agent()` calls.
- `orchestrator/docs/agents/project-manifest/api-surface.md` — added `### src/utils/path_middleware.py` section documenting all public symbols and their signatures.
- `orchestrator/docs/agents/project-manifest/file-tree.md` — added `path_middleware.py` to `src/utils/` directory listing and `test_path_middleware.py` to the tests listing with descriptions.

### Verification Summary
- Tests run: `tests/test_path_middleware.py` (25 tests), `tests/test_nodes.py::TestPathMiddlewareWiring` (1 test), full suite `python3 -m pytest` (1072 passed, 6 skipped)
- Static analysis run: `python3 -m ruff check` — clean on all modified/created files
- Result: PASS — 26 new tests pass; 5 pre-existing failures in `test_cli.py` / `test_run_metadata.py` (unrelated to this plan, related to `_infer_project_root` on temp paths)

### Code Insights
- [low] (improvement) `orchestrator/src/nodes/__init__.py`: The three local imports inside `node_fn` (`load_persona`, `load_subagents`, and the deepagents imports) follow a deferred-import pattern that isn't applied consistently across `src.utils.*` imports. `PathNormalizationMiddleware` was added at module level (consistent with `inject_project_path`, `log_tool_calls`, etc.) rather than inside `node_fn`, making the pattern split visible. A future cleanup could consolidate all deferred imports at one level.
- [low] (debt) `orchestrator/tests/test_path_middleware.py`: The `_make_request` helper uses a plain `MagicMock` rather than a real `ToolCallRequest` dataclass. This is intentional (constructing a real `ToolCallRequest` requires `BaseTool` and `ToolRuntime` stubs), but it means the tests don't catch API drift in `ToolCallRequest.override()`. If the real `override()` signature changes, tests may still pass. Consider pinning the LangChain version or adding a smoke test that constructs a real `ToolCallRequest`.
- [low] (improvement) `orchestrator/src/utils/path_middleware.py`: The `awrap_tool_call` type annotations use `ToolMessage | Any` as the return type, which is effectively `Any`. This is pragmatic given that Deep Agents can return `Command` objects too, but a more precise union `ToolMessage | Command[Any]` (matching the base class signature) would be more informative. Not changed here to avoid importing `Command` from langchain_core unnecessarily.

### Additional Comments
- The `_active` flag approach (set once at `__init__` time based on `root_dir`) is the recommended pattern: it avoids a `re.match` call in every `awrap_tool_call` invocation on macOS/Linux where the middleware is a no-op.
- The `project-path-reminder.md` change is backward compatible — it adds informational text that helps agents understand virtual path semantics without changing any variable placeholders or template logic.
- The pre-existing test failures (`TestWriteErrorStatusEarlyExits`, `TestTerminalResumeMetadata`) were confirmed to be unrelated to this plan by verifying they fail on paths inside pytest temp directories that don't match the `docs/agents/plans/<slug>` depth convention required by `_infer_project_root()`.
