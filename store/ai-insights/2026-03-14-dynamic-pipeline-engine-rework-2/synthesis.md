# Project Synthesis Report
**Project:** Dynamic Pipeline Engine Rework — Phase 2  
**Date:** 2026-03-14  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Pipeline Health:** 12 / 12 stages PASS (3 WPs × 4 pipelines each)

---

## Executive Summary

This project eliminated all hardcoded pipeline type lists from Zod `.describe()` annotation strings across the MCP server's tool schema files. The fix was to introduce a single `describePipelineTypes(prefix: string)` helper in `pipeline-maps.ts` that derives its output dynamically from the `PIPELINE_TYPES` const tuple — the source of truth — and then migrate all 6 call sites to use it.

**The root cause being fixed:** `observations.ts` had silently drifted to listing only 4 pipeline types in its Zod annotation after the new `security-audit` and `release-engineering` types were added, because the annotation string was hardcoded. The same risk existed at 5 other call sites. The fix ensures that all future pipeline type additions are automatically reflected in tool schema annotations with no manual changes required.

Three parallel work packages delivered the complete fix: implementation + migration (WP-001), drift-detection test coverage (WP-002), and manifest documentation (WP-003).

## Strategic Recommendations (Gold Nuggets)

### 1. Drift-Detection Testing Pattern — Adopt as Standard

The drift-detection tests added in WP-002 dynamically construct expected values from the live `PIPELINE_TYPES` array rather than hardcoding expected strings. This means the tests automatically adapt when new pipeline types are added — no test updates are required.

**Recommendation:** Adopt this pattern as the standard for all enum/const-tuple annotation helpers in this codebase. Any future helper similar to `describePipelineTypes` should have a companion test that constructs its expected output from the source-of-truth array.

### 2. Constraint + Test Cross-Reference Pattern

Constraint 68 was written with an enforcement note explicitly cross-referencing the drift-detection test in `pipeline-maps.test.ts`. This creates a self-reinforcing loop: the constraint tells agents *what to do*; the test link tells them *where regression protection lives*.

**Recommendation:** All future constraints governing code patterns should include a test cross-reference where a test can be written to enforce them. This is especially valuable for patterns that are easy to accidentally revert.

### 3. Concrete Historical Examples in Constraint Rationale

Constraint 68's rationale cites the specific historical drift example (`observations.ts` listing 4 types when 6 existed). This detail makes the rule memorable, unambiguous, and traceable — agents reading it understand *why* the constraint exists, not just *what* it demands.

**Recommendation:** When authoring new constraints, include a concrete historical failure example in the rationale section wherever one exists.

## Known Tech Debt (Not Blocked — Pre-Existing)

The following items were identified during this session as pre-existing and out of scope. They represent concrete candidates for follow-up work packages:

### High Priority

_None._

### Medium Priority

_None identified._

### Low Priority

1. **`pipeline.ts` tool-registration prose string (line ~725):** The `server.registerTool('ledger_start_pipeline', ...)` call contains a hardcoded prose description `'The type must be one of: "implementation", "qa", "code-review", "documentation"'` listing only 4 types. This is a the tool-level description (not a Zod annotation) and was outside WP-001 scope. A follow-up WP should derive this string from `PIPELINE_TYPES` via a similar helper.

2. **`agent_role` `.describe()` strings in `StartPipelineSchema` and `CompletePipelineSchema`:** Currently list only 4 roles (`Developer`, `QA`, `Reviewer`, `Documentation`) and omit `Security Auditor` and `Release Engineer`. A `describePipelineAgents()` helper analogous to `describePipelineTypes()` would consolidate the role list at its source of truth and prevent future role-drift in these annotations.

3. **`mcp-server/changelog.md` not updated:** No changelog entry exists for this session's deliverables. A future version bump (candidate: v1.11.3 or next minor) should capture: `Utils: Added describePipelineTypes() helper to pipeline-maps.ts; replaced 6 hardcoded .describe() pipeline-type lists across tool schema files; added 4-test drift-detection suite`.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Open a follow-up WP** for the `ledger_start_pipeline` tool-registration description string (item #1 above) — it is the same class of problem as this project but for a different call site type.
2. **Consider `describePipelineAgents()`** (item #2 above) — a companion to `describePipelineTypes()` that eliminates role-list drift from Zod schema annotations.
3. **Update `changelog.md`** for the MCP server with entries summarizing this session's changes before the next version release.
