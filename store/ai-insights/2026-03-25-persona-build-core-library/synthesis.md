# Synthesis Report — Persona Build Core Library

**Plan:** `2026-03-25-persona-build-core-library`
**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Version Delivered:** `@smor/persona-build` v0.2.0

---

## Executive Summary

The `ai-persona-builder-STABLE` repository was scaffolded from an empty project and fully built into a
production-ready, dual CJS + ESM TypeScript npm library in a single session. The library extracts the
generic persona build engine from `ai-insights`' `scripts/build-personas.js` and
`scripts/lib/persona-helpers.js`, wrapping it in a clean plugin/decorator architecture with a
programmatic API and an optional CLI.

Seven work packages were executed across five agent roles (Developer, QA, Security Auditor, Reviewer,
Release Engineer, Documentation). All 38 acceptance criteria were met with zero rework cycles. The
delivered artefact is version 0.2.0 — the first functional release.

## Strategic Recommendations (Gold Nuggets)

### 1. Zero-dependency engine layer — preserve this invariant

All five engine modules (`partials.ts`, `conditionals.ts`, `variables.ts`, `postProcessor.ts`,
`serializer.ts`) have **zero imports** — not even Node built-ins. This makes the engine fully
portable to browser environments or non-Node runtimes. Any future engine addition should maintain
this zero-dependency invariant.

### 2. Synchronous runner — plan for async before integrating remote plugins

The plugin runner (`src/plugins/runner.ts`) is fully synchronous. This is correct for the current
use case. Before Plan 2 integrates any plugin that performs network or heavy async I/O (e.g. a
schema-fetching plugin), the runner functions will need to be refactored to `async` + sequential
`await`. Design the Plan 2 plugin interface with this in mind.

### 3. `strict:true + check:true` is the CI-safe pattern

When `strict:true` is used **without** `check:true`, `build()` writes all output files to disk
before throwing on validation failures — leaving partial artefacts. The Reviewer documented this
in the `build()` JSDoc and README. All CI pipelines calling `build()` in validation mode should
always combine `strict: true` with `check: true`.

### 4. Path traversal trust boundary — document before any HTTP surface

The loaders (`loadPartials`, `discoverPersonaYamls`, `loadContent`) pass caller-supplied paths
directly to `fs/promises` APIs. The Security Auditor rated this Medium risk — acceptable for a
build-time library with developer-controlled paths. If any future layer exposes these functions
to CLI arguments, plugin-provided paths, or HTTP input, a `path.resolve(input).startsWith(allowedRoot)`
containment guard must be added before that exposure.

### 5. Bump `engines.node` to `>=18.17.0`

`readdir` with `{ recursive: true }` (used in `discoverPersonaYamls`) requires Node ≥ 18.17.
The current `package.json` states `>=18.0.0`. This creates a confusing `TypeError` window for
consumers on Node 18.0–18.16. Update the `engines` field before 1.0.

### 6. `TargetType` duplicate re-export — clean up before 1.0

`TargetType` is currently re-exported from both `src/plugins/index.ts` and `src/builders/index.ts`,
both flowing into `src/index.ts` via `export *`. TypeScript silently deduplicates type-only
re-exports today, but a future value export collision would produce a hard error. The canonical
home is `src/plugins/types.ts`; remove the re-export from `src/builders/index.ts` before 1.0.

### 7. `serializeTools` single-quote escaping — known gap for tool names

`serializeTools()` does not escape single quotes inside tool names (e.g. `Tool's` → `['Tool's']`
which is invalid YAML). This is acceptable for alphanumeric tool names but should be documented
as a known limitation. Add escaping before any consumer registers tool names with apostrophes.

### 8. `cc_model` / `cc_permission_mode` / `cc_memory` — not auto-derived

The default Claude Code frontmatter template references these three context variables, but they
are not auto-computed by `buildContext()`. They must come from `_shared.yaml` or a plugin. The
README now documents this, but Plan 2's ledger plugin should ensure these fields are injected
reliably, or a built-in validator should warn when they are absent.

## Failures / Blockers

None. No pipeline stages failed. No acceptance criteria were missed. No security blockers found.

## Next Steps (Plan 2 and Beyond)

1. **Plan 2 — Ledger Plugin:** Build the `ai-insights`-specific ledger plugin for `ai-persona-builder`.
   Implement `renderRoster()` and `renderMcpToolsTable()` as `onPostRender` / `onBuildContext` plugin
   hooks. Integrate the library into `scripts/build-personas.js` to replace the inline implementation.

2. **Node version alignment:** Bump `engines.node` from `>=18.0.0` to `>=18.17.0` in the library's
   `package.json`.

3. **Pre-1.0 tech debt:** Clean up `TargetType` duplicate re-export path; add single-quote escaping
   to `serializeTools()`; consider exporting `FilenameRule` interface for extensibility.

4. **CLI test coverage:** Add an automated child-process integration test (`spawn dist/cli.js` + exit
   code assertions) to give stronger regression protection for the CLI layer.

5. **Async runner readiness:** Design Plan 2 plugin hooks with async compatibility in mind so the
   runner refactor (when needed) is a non-breaking change.
