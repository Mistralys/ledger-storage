## Synthesis

### Completion Status
- Date: 2026-07-07
- Status: COMPLETE
- Completed by: Standalone Developer Agent

### Outcome Summary

Extended `PathNormalizationMiddleware` from a Windows-only rewriter to a cross-platform
absolute path rewriter. The middleware is now active on macOS and Linux (where `root_dir`
starts with `/` and has length > 1), eliminating the failure mode where agents pass absolute
POSIX host paths to Deep Agents file tools and receive silent ghost-directory creation instead
of correct virtual-path routing.

### Implementation Summary

- **`orchestrator/src/utils/path_middleware.py`**: Broadened `_active` flag to cover any
  non-trivial absolute path (Windows drive letter or POSIX). Added `_is_rewritable()` method
  that encapsulates detection logic for both Windows and POSIX paths. Updated `_rewrite_args`
  to call `_is_rewritable` instead of the previous Windows-only `_WIN_PATH_RE.match` check.
  Updated module docstring, class docstring, `_to_virtual` docstring, and `awrap_tool_call`
  docstring to remove Windows-only framing and describe cross-platform behaviour.
- **`orchestrator/tests/test_path_middleware.py`**: Updated module docstring. Replaced the
  `test_inactive_for_posix_root` test (now incorrect) with `test_active_for_macos_root`,
  `test_active_for_linux_root`, and `test_inactive_for_bare_slash`. Added POSIX test cases to
  `TestToVirtual`, `TestRewriteArgs`, `TestAwrapToolCall`, and `TestAwrapToolCallWithRealRequest`.
  Updated `test_inactive_on_posix_root_returns_none` to reflect that the middleware IS active
  but only rewrites paths matching the root prefix. Total tests grew from 25 to 41.
- **`orchestrator/src/nodes/__init__.py`**: Updated inline comment to remove macOS/Linux no-op
  language and add a POSIX example path; also corrected the constraint reference from `§22` to
  `§26`.
- **`orchestrator/docs/agents/project-manifest/constraints.md`**: Updated constraint §26
  rationale to describe cross-platform activation, updated the correct-pattern comment, and
  updated the complementary dependency description to reference cross-platform rather than
  Windows-only support.

### Documentation Updates

- `orchestrator/docs/agents/project-manifest/constraints.md` §26 updated to reflect the
  middleware's new cross-platform scope — necessary because the constraint's rationale
  previously described the middleware as a no-op on macOS/Linux, which is now incorrect.

### Verification Summary

- Tests run: `orchestrator/tests/test_path_middleware.py` (41 tests), full orchestrator test
  suite (1093 tests + 6 skipped)
- Static analysis run: none required (no new dependencies or structural changes)
- Result: PASS — 41/41 path middleware tests pass; 1093/1093 orchestrator tests pass with 0
  regressions

### Code Insights

- [low] (debt) `orchestrator/src/nodes/__init__.py` line ~877: The constraint reference in the
  inline comment was `§22` before this change, but the actual constraint is §26. This was a
  stale reference from a prior renumbering of constraints. Fixed as part of this plan.
- [low] (improvement) `orchestrator/src/utils/path_middleware.py` `_is_rewritable`: The method
  currently only handles flat string values. If Deep Agents ever passes nested path structures
  (e.g. `{"files": ["/abs/path/a", "/abs/path/b"]}`), `_rewrite_args` would silently skip
  them. A future improvement could add recursive list/dict traversal, but this is out of scope
  for the current plan since Deep Agents tool signatures use flat string arguments.

### Additional Comments

- The `test_inactive_on_posix_root_returns_none` test name was preserved for continuity but
  its assertion was inverted: `_active` is now `True` for POSIX roots; the test now verifies
  that a non-matching POSIX path returns `None` from `_rewrite_args`.
- The bare `/` exclusion (`len(root_dir) > 1`) is important for correctness: if root were `/`,
  every virtual path like `/src/file.ts` would match the prefix and be rewritten to `//src/file.ts`.
