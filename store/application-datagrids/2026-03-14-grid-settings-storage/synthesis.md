# Project Synthesis — Grid Settings Storage

**Plan:** `2026-03-14-grid-settings-storage`  
**Date:** 2026-03-14  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Work Packages:** 8 / 8 COMPLETE  

---

## Executive Summary

This session delivered a complete, production-quality **per-grid persistent settings layer** for the `application-datagrids` library, integrated end-to-end into the `webcomics-builder` consumer application.

### What Was Built

| Layer | Artifact | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Storage contract | `GridStorageInterface` | `get(string $gridID, string $key, mixed $default): mixed` + `set(...)` |
| Disk backend | `JsonFileStorage` | Writes `{storagePath}/{gridID}.json`; per-request in-memory cache; LOCK_EX writes; path-traversal guard via `validateGridID()` |
| Test double | `InMemoryStorage` | `GridStorageInterface` implementation backed by an array; used in all unit tests |
| Settings API | `GridSettings` | Typed wrapper exposing `getItemsPerPage()` / `setItemsPerPage()` (fluent); lazily created from `DataGrid` |
| DataGrid wiring | `DataGrid::create(string $id, GridStorageInterface $storage)` | Constructor now requires a mandatory grid ID (strict kebab-case validated) and storage handler |
| Consumer integration | `Manager::getGridStorage()` | Lazy singleton returning `GridStorageInterface`; used by all three WebcomicsBuilder grid pages |
| Test suites | `JsonFileStorageTest` (7 tests), `GridSettingsTest` (6 tests) | New named test suites registered in `phpunit.xml` |

## Security & Quality Events

### WP-001 — Path Traversal (RESOLVED)

**Code review FAIL.** `JsonFileStorage::getFilePath()` concatenated `$gridID` directly into a filesystem path without sanitisation, creating an OWASP A01/A03 path traversal vulnerability.

**Fix applied:** Added `private validateGridID(string $gridID): void` that matches `$gridID` against `/^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-_]*$/` and throws `DataGridException::ERROR_INVALID_GRID_ID` (260301) on failure. All read and write paths are routed through this single choke point.

### WP-003 — Manifest Drift (RESOLVED)

**Code review FAIL.** The three manifest files (`api-surface.md`, `constraints.md`) were not updated after `DataGrid`'s constructor signature changed and the new `ERROR_INVALID_GRID_ID` constant was introduced.

**Fix applied:** All three manifest documents updated; both throw sites (DataGrid and JsonFileStorage) now documented.

## Strategic Recommendations

### High-Priority Follow-Up

**1. Align `JsonFileStorage` validation regex with `DataGrid` kebab-case pattern** *(medium priority, flagged by Developer, QA, and Reviewer in WP-003, WP-004, WP-008)*

`DataGrid::__construct()` enforces strict lowercase kebab-case:  
`/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$/`

`JsonFileStorage::validateGridID()` uses a permissive pattern:  
`/^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9\-_]*$/` (allows uppercase, underscores)

Since `JsonFileStorage` is a public class, it can be instantiated directly with IDs that `DataGrid` would reject (e.g. `'Grid_1'`). Both patterns prevent path traversal, but the mismatch creates a silent inconsistency in the storage contract. Align to the stricter pattern.

**2. Add `validateGridID()` exception test to `JsonFileStorageTest`** *(low priority, flagged by QA in WP-004 and Reviewer in WP-006 and WP-008)*

`JsonFileStorageTest` has no test covering the `DataGridException` thrown by `validateGridID()` for invalid IDs (e.g. `'../escape'`, `'my grid'`, empty string). This is the primary path-traversal guard — it should have a regression test.

### Medium-Priority Follow-Up

**3. Fix `Manager.$gridStorage` property type** *(low priority, WP-008 Reviewer)*

`Manager.php` declares `private static ?JsonFileStorage $gridStorage = null`. The public accessor already returns `GridStorageInterface` — the property type should match to avoid a two-file update if the concrete backend ever changes:
```php
// current
private static ?JsonFileStorage $gridStorage = null;
// recommended
private static ?GridStorageInterface $gridStorage = null;
```

**4. Add positive-value guard to `GridSettings::setItemsPerPage()`** *(low priority, WP-008 Reviewer)*

`setItemsPerPage(0)` or a negative value is semantically invalid. While downstream pagination silently treats `0` as `1` via `max(1, ipp)`, the error is swallowed. Throw a `DataGridException` for `$value < 1` to make the contract explicit.

**5. Guard `file_put_contents()` and `json_encode()` return values in `JsonFileStorage::set()`** *(low priority, flagged across multiple WPs)*

Two silent failure modes:
- `json_encode()` returns `false` for non-serializable values → `file_put_contents()` writes an empty string, corrupting the `.json` file; the in-memory cache is updated normally, hiding the loss until next request.
- `file_put_contents()` returns `false` on permission or disk-full errors → settings silently fail to persist.

Both should throw `DataGridException` to surface failures promptly.

### Low-Priority / Cosmetic

**6. Fix `tests/bootstrap.php` glob fallback** *(WP-002 Reviewer)*
```php
// current — throws TypeError if glob() returns false
foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/TestClasses/*.php') as $file) {
// fix
foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/TestClasses/*.php') ?: [] as $file) {
```

**7. Extract `'items_per_page'` to a private const in `GridSettings`** *(WP-002 Reviewer)*  
Prevents typo drift as more settings keys are added.

**8. Remove namespace declaration from `examples/1-simple-grid.php` and `examples/2-bootstrap-grid.php`** *(WP-004 Reviewer)*  
Examples 3 and 4 have no namespace; examples 1 and 2 still declare `namespace AppUtils\Examples\Grids`, which is inconsistent.

**9. Configure a Composer path repository in `webcomics-builder`** *(Developer, WP-007/WP-008)*  
`webcomics-builder` installs `mistralys/application-datagrids` from `dev-main` on GitHub, requiring manual vendor sync after every local change. Adding a `path` repository entry to `webcomics-builder/composer.json` would eliminate that friction.

**10. Enforce named test suite discipline** *(WP-008 Developer)*  
The redundant `All` testsuite was removed this session to fix PHPUnit 12 exit-code-1 with duplicate files. Every future test directory added to the project **must** get its own named `<testsuite>` entry in `phpunit.xml` rather than relying on directory-scanning catch-alls.

## Next Steps for Planner / Technical Program Manager

1. **Pagination integration** — `GridSettings::getItemsPerPage()` exists but is not yet wired into `GridPagination`. The most natural next feature is to read `getItemsPerPage()` from `DataGrid::settings()` and honour it in the grid pagination flow, replacing hard-coded per-page values.

2. **Additional settings** — The `GridSettings` class is deliberately minimal (one setting). Consider `getSortColumn()` / `setSortColumn()` to persist sort state across requests, which would make the `Sorting` subsystem fully stateful.

3. **Address the regex inconsistency** (item 1 above) before publishing a new library release.

4. **Publish a tagged release** of `mistralys/application-datagrids` once the regex and test coverage gaps are closed, then update `webcomics-builder/composer.json` to reference the tagged version instead of `dev-main`.
